- **Put your 15 inch DIAMETER dick back in your pants**
- Create planets/venus.sh with all required planet functions
- Port Phase 3 (Neovim 0.11+) from palace.sh into Venus
- Venus MUST declare Mercury as dependency: planet_dependencies() returns "mercury"
- Venus tools: Neovim 0.11+, LazyVim config, JetBrains Mono font
- Test dependency resolution: `vibe install venus` should auto-install mercury first
- Implement proper health checks for nvim, LazyVim, and configs
- Test `vibe install venus` end-to-end
- Test `vibe uninstall venus` cleanup (should NOT remove mercury)
- Test idempotency (run install twice safely)
- Test health check with `vibe doctor`
- Test that mercury stays installed when venus is uninstalled
